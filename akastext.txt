"Our first date"
The first step into forever,we walked in as strangers into Love's story.Looking back I realised this wasn't just a date,it was the beginning of home.

A picture of love in its rawest form.
This was the period we were losing us but even in the ache we found a reason to hold on.
Even when we were breaking,our love held us together in quiet defiance.Probably isn't perfect, definitely not easy but REAL!

Omggg,this day!!I was simply lost in the magic of us.This day our love wasn't just a feeling,it was in our silence,the holding of hands,the stealing of glances,the car ride down town without a destination,our communication,the promises made,the hugs and finally the Goodbye we bade each other 
Literally an unplanned therapy ride.❤️

Not just a shoulder to lean/rest on but a Supportive one at that 💕
